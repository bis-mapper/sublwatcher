# Getting Started

Type `SUBL` on a report that you want to open in BIS.

You will get prompted with a dialog box asking you to find the *sublime_text.exe*.
This should be stored in your program files where you installed Sublime.
Navigate to that folder and select the *sublime_text.exe*

## Your file watching folder (sublwatcher)

Some files are downloaded to your workstation when you run the `SUBL` command.  These files are stored in the sublwatcher folder (%USERPROFILE% usually c:\users\winne\sublwatcher\)

A browse utility will pop up asking you where you want to put the file that your opening.
