# Getting Started

Type `SUBL` on a report that you want to open in BIS.

You will get prompted with a dialog box asking you to find the *sublime_text.exe*.
This should be stored in your program files where you installed Sublime.
Navigate to that folder and select the *sublime_text.exe*

## Your file watching folder (sublwatcher)

Some files are downloaded to your workstation when you run the `SUBL` command.  These files are stored in the sublwatcher folder 
`%USERPROFILE% usually c:\users\winne\sublwatcher\`

A browse utility will pop up asking you where you want to put the file that your opening.

The BIS report that you typed `SUBL` on will now be saved in this folder and you should be able to modify this file in Sublime and have the changes saved back to BIS.

## Watching Files
You can also type `SUBLWATCHER` on the control line to start the file watching utility.  This skips the process of opening up a specific report and starts the script that watches the files.  This is helpful if you already have the files you want open and just need to start saving the changes back to MAPPER.

## Thanks
A big thanks goes out to John Thalhuber and ITRS for allowing me to use portions of their code in this software.  I'm also very appreciative of the SETUP+ package that he created which allows this application to be installed onto other MAPPER systems with very little friction.  

I'd also like to thank North Star Mutual for allowing me to develop this product.  It's been a joy to be able to build a tool that allows me to get my job done faster with less pain and frustration.  

## Bug Reports
Please report any issues you find with this product in the issues tab in this repository.  I'll do my best to fix issues in a reasonable amount of time, but I get pulled in a lot of directions, and don't always have time to work on this, so be patient if I'm not able to address it very quickly.

## Contributing
If you see features that you would like or want to make something work different feel free to submit pull requests and I'll see if it's something that will fit.  

## Support
At this time I'm only supporting Windows 7.  It was working on XP before switching to Windows 7 and I'm hoping Windows 8 will work out of the box.  If you would like support for other platforms you may have to modify it to work for you.
